Snap: Simple photo management
=============================

Snap aims to be very good at a single thing: helping you with your digital
photo management workflow. It won't feature red-eye removal, one-touch image
enhancement, or any other neato gimmicks. It just provides a clean and easy
interface for organizing your photos. Snap wants to get out of your way and
leave the heavy lifting to more specialized applications. If it is doing its
job, you won't spend very much of your time using Snap at all.

Desired features
----------------
  * arbitrary tagging support
     * enables any kind of workflow
     * fixed tags can be dropped onto images from a "tag bar" on one side
     * the tag list can be reordered (it is rank ordered by default, by
       frequency of use if the user doesn't specify an order)
     * the tag list can have a "more" expander (a la GMail tags) once it grows
       beyond a usable height
     * tags can be assigned a color (defaults to semi-random color distribution
       scheme)
  * implicit tagging support
     * the app will tag if the user has "seen" this photo before, thereby
       sensing new image additions by their absence of this tag
     * various statistics can be generated and added/edited as tags (# times
       viewed, etc)
  * tag view (only photos with a given tag(s) are shown... see search view) 
  * calendar view (heat-mapped calendar widget, pale blue -> bright red),
    probably implemented on top of the search API
  * image view (a single image)
    * a summary pane with tag & EXIF information displayed
    * right and left navigation
    * fullscreen button
    * slideshow (optional)
    * GPS coords on a map?!
  * search view (search by tag, file name, date, etc.)
  * remove tag(s) (removes the given tags from the selected items)
  * remove image (deletes the image, with a little sanity dialog)
  * rubber band select & ctrl+a select
  * lossless rotate!
  * delete file (prompts if a RAW file with the same name exists)
  * delete just attached RAW file
  * open file in other program
  * open attached RAW files in other program (def: Gimp or other RAW editor)
  * date-ordered tree (files are named YYYYMMDDhhmmssxx.[jpeg,jpg,nef,???] and
    live in a directory like YYYY/MM/DD/[file])
  * import dialog allows user to select which photos (including "all") to
    import
  * user can change the thumbnail size in the various views
  * has default values on import for artist, copyright, etc.
  * allows the user to edit some EXIF/IPTC/XMP fields on a per-image basis

Implementation ideas
--------------------
  * file import ties into gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor
  * Tracker for tags, search, etc
  * Vala with minimal dependencies for simplicity and maintainability
  * design UI w/Marijana's heavy input
  * write API first
  * look into XMP metadata (the exempi library can be wrapped)
    * the application will look in the XMP payload to read & write tags, but
      they will need to be synched with the underlying EXIF & IPTC tags to be
      100% portable
  * each photo has the tags embedded into its EXIF metadata
  * look into libopenraw for NEF support
  * for unified EXIF/IPTC/XMP + thumbnail extraction, exiv2 sounds perfect (but
    it's in C++... which blows)
  * GStreamer seems to also have support for tags, but possibly only for
    reading...
  * extract the thumb from the image, if possible
  * focus on SPEED! (import, navigation, search, etc)
  * if the object model & API are well-designed, consider embedding Gjs or
    SEED for workflow scripting & plugins
  * to display maps, look into libchamplain
