v0.1.0
------
* finish the basic tag daemon
* expose request processing signals to DBus somehow...
* make the GLib.Value stuff prettier (or find a shortcut in Vala's docs)
* design a metadata daemon, too
  * ideally, it should be able to modify any valid metadata key
  * more realistically, it could have translation and amplification for common
    keys
    * Artist => Exif.Image.Artist, Xmp.dc.creator
    * Copyright => Exif.Image.Copyright, Iptc.Application2.Copyright, Xmp.dc.rights
    * Title => Xmp.dc.title
    * Description => Exif.Image.ImageDescription, Xmp.dc.description
    * Keywords (note: these are where the tags are kept) => Iptc.Application2.Keywords, Xmp.dc.subject
  * better yet, only use one set (Xmp > Iptc > Exif in my mind), simplifying
    implementation and removing the need to keep lots of different sets of
    metadata in sync
    * this means I could just use exempi, I do believe...
* use GConf for settings (stick it into Daemon base class)
  * photo directory
  * seconds for daemons to hang around
  * Exif.Author default
  * Iptc.Contact default
  * Exif.Copyright default (maybe with string interpolation, e.g. "Copyright Â© %Y
    Marijana Surkovic. All rights reserved.")
* moves and deletes are scary (terrifying, actually!)... consider copies and
  moves, respectively, instead
  * "move" just copies from the source to the dest
  * "delete" moves to a "trash" directory, which can be purged periodically or
    browsed and reinstated (via the import API!)
* implement duplicate checking in the import daemon!
* investigate whether there's a maximum argument length for DBus (batch calls
  could get huge)
* implement logging!
  * in the daemon base class
  * in the user's data dir
  * maybe use GLib.Environment.get_application_name () to avoid logging as the
    base class
* implement artist and copyright settings and defaults in the import daemon
  * better yet, use the metadata daemon (see above)
* write a test harness
